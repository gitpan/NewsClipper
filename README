News Clipper is an information integrator. It creates a custom web page from a
template HTML file with special tags, replacing those tags with dynamic
information acquired from the internet.

This is the Open Source version of News Clipper.  You either got this in
conjunction with a purchase of a commercial version, or in source-only form.
If you got it the latter way, you can buy the commercial version which will
get you: technical support, a nice user's manual, pre-compiled binaries, and
free upgrades for a year.

Please send me any modifications you make to the main script. (for the better,
that is. :) Keep in mind that I'm likely to turn down obscure features to
avoid including everything but the kitchen sink. Check out the TODO file for
ways you can help, and DESIGN for a quick description of the major modules.
A major contribution will get you a free license for the commercial version.

See the file CHANGES for a list of changes since the last version.


SUPPORT & DOCUMENTATION

You can join the News Clipper mailing list at
http://www.newsclipper.com/techsup.htm, where you will also find a FAQ. This
list is archived at
http://www.mail-archive.com/newsclipperlist%40newsclipper.com.

'perldoc NewsClipper.pl' will give you an overview of the software.
The file userman.html in this distribution provides an (outdated) overview of
the command syntax. 

Also try running with the -d switch if you have problems, or see the FAQ at
http://www.newsclipper.com/techsup.htm.


PREREQUISITES

- If you do not have Perl installed on your system, download and install it
  from http://www.perl.com/. You will need Perl version 5.004 or newer.
- Windows users will need to install nmake if they do not already have it. It
  can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe
- News Clipper requires the following packages:
    TimeDate
    Time-modules
    URI
    HTML::Parser
    HTML::Tree
    libwww
  Be advised that these modules also require other modules:
    URI requires MIME::Base64
    HTML::Tree requires libwww and Font::AFM
    libwww requires URI, MIME::Base64, HTML::Parser, and Net::FTP (in libnet).
  In addition, Windows users will need to install the latest version of
  libwin32, and RedHat Linux users should install a newer version of IO.

  Windows users should use the ppm utility that comes with ActivePerl to
  install these modules. Run "ppm", then type "install MODULE" for each
  module, in the following order: MIME-Base64, libnet, Font-AFM,
  Digest-MD5, URI, HTML-Parser, libwww-perl, TimeDate, Time-modules, HTML-Tree,
  libwin32

  Non-Windows users should download and install the modules from the following
  URLs, in order:
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MIME/MIME-Base64-2.11.tar.gz
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Net/libnet-1.0606.tar.gz
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Font/Font-AFM-1.18.tar.gz
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MD5/Digest-MD5-2.09.tar.gz
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/URI/URI-1.04.tar.gz

INSTALLATION

- run "perl Makefile.PL"
- On Unix-like systems, you have the option of installing News Clipper as a
  single user, or system-wide. Install as a single user if you do not have
  root access on your system, or if you do not want to make News Clipper
  accessible to all the users on your system.

  For a single user installation, you will have to specify the locations of
  the News Clipper root directory, and the manual pages. You can create a
  symbolic link from the binaries in the bin subdirectory to your ~/bin
  directory, or augment your PATH environment variable to include the bin
  subdirectory.  Likewise, you can specify an man page installation path that
  is already in your MANPATH environment variable, or augment your MANPATH
  environment variable.

  For a system-wide installation, the installation program will install the
  programs and man pages in the default perl locations. The system-wide
  NewsClipper.cfg file should be placed in a location that is readable by all
  users. (And make sure the permissions are set correctly.)
- On Windows systems, you will need to specify a location where News Clipper
  can store its handlers and configuration information. You will also need to
  specify your time zone in one of the following formats.
    Universal:  GMT, UT
    US zones :  EST, EDT, CST, CDT, MST, MDT, PST, PDT
    Military :  A to Z (except J)
    Other    :  +HHMM or -HHMM
    ISO 8601 :  +HH:MM, +HH, -HH:MM, -HH
  For example, if you are in the Central Standard Time zone, you would enter
  "CST"
- run "make" or "nmake"
- run "make install" or "nmake install"
- run "make NewsClipper_Cleanup" or "nmake NewsClipper_Cleanup"
  There is a bug in some versions of Perl for Windows that causes the
  following error to appear during installation:
    Can't modify blib\script\MakeHandler.pl at (eval 2) line 51, <FIXIN> chunk 1
  This error does not appear to be significant.


CONFIGURING

- On Windows systems, the location of the configuration file is stored in the
  registry.
- On non-Windows systems, configuration information is first looked for in the
  system-wide location specified by the NEWSCLIPPER environment variable. News
  Clipper will then load the user's NewsClipper.cfg from $home/.NewsClipper.
  Options that appear in the personal configuration file override those in the
  system-wide configuration file.

  This means that a user's configuration file can consist solely of
    %config = (
      'inputFiles' => ['input.txt'],
      'outputFiles' => ['output.html'],
    );
- Each line in the News Clipper configuration file (NewsClipper.cfg) that
  begins with a '#' is a comment that describes the option following it.
- When you register News Clipper, replace YOUR_EMAIL_HERE with your email,
  exactly as you gave it during the registration process. Replace
  YOUR_REG_KEY_HERE with the registration key you are given.
- If you use a proxy for accessing the web, enter the proxy's URL for the
  "proxy" option, and set the user name and password if you desire.
- The remaining options should not need modification.


TESTING

- To run on Windows platforms, start a command prompt and change directories
  to the SampleFiles directory included in the distribution. Run
  "perl INSTALLDIR\bin\NewsClipper.pl"
- To run on non-Windows platforms, change directories to the SampleFiles
  directory included in the distribution. Run "INSTALLDIR/bin/NewsClipper.pl"
  for a single-user installation, or something like "/usr/bin/NewsClipper.pl"
  for a system-wide installation.

This will cause News Clipper to process the input file specified in the
NewsClipper.cfg file. (When you first install News Clipper, this will be a
file located in the SampleFiles directory.) The first time you run News
Clipper, there will be a series of prompts that ask you whether or not News
Clipper can download the handlers it needs. There is also some delay in
contacting the handler server and the content provider. Please be patient.
Subsequent executions will be faster.

The default installation processes a sample input file found in the
"INSTALLDIR\SampleFiles" directory.  You can view the output file (located in
"INSTALLDIR\SampleFiles\output.html") using your favorite web browser.


ADDING DYNAMIC CONTENT TO YOUR SITE

To see how News Clipper might add value to your web site, do the following:
- Choose a web page to enhance.
- Edit you configuration file so that the full path and filename of the file
  is specified for the input file. (Optionally, you can change the output
  file.)
- Edit you input file using a text editor, or an HTML editor.
- Choose a suitable location for the content, and then insert one of the
  following News Clipper commands as an HTML comment:

  <!--newsclipper
    <input name=yahootopstories source=ap>
    <filter name=map filter=hash2string
             format='<a href="%{url}">%{headline}</a>'>>
    <filter name=limit number=10>
    <output name=array numcols=1>
  -->

  <!--newsclipper
    <input name=yahootopstories source=reuters>
    <filter name=map filter=hash2string
             format='<a href="%{url}">%{headline}</a>'>>
    <filter name=limit number=10>
    <output name=array numcols=2>
  -->

  <!--newsclipper
    <input name=yahootopstories source=sports>
    <filter name=map filter=hash2string
             format='%{url}: %{headline}'>>
    <filter name=limit number=10>
    <output name=array numcols=1>
  -->

  <!--newsclipper
    <input name=yahootopstories source=ap>
    <filter name=map filter=hash2string
             format='<a href="%{url}">%{headline}</a>'>>
    <filter name=limit number=10>
    <output name=array numcols=1 prefix='--&gt;' suffix='<br>'>
  -->

- Run News Clipper to create the output file.
- View the output file in your favorite browser.
